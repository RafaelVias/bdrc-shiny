This shiny app is built for the R package **bdrc** (Bayesian Discharge Rating Curve) which has been developed with data from Icelandic and Swedish rivers. The package includes four models. bplm, bplm0, bgplm0, bgplm:

e.g.
   
**bgplm()** is used to fit a rating curve for paired measurements of stage and discharge using a Bayesian Power Law Model as described in Hrafnkelsson et al.


_Example_
```{r,eval=FALSE}
data(V316_river)
set.seed(1)
formula <- Q~W
bgplm.fit <- bgplm(formula,V316_river)
summary(bgplm.fit)
plot(bgplm.fit)
bgplm.fit_known_c <- bgplm(formula,V316_river,c_param=0.75,h_max=2)
summary(bgplm.fit_known_c)
plot(bgplm.fit_known_c)
```

For further examples and documentation visit [the Github page](https://github.com/sor16/bdrc).   
All of the functions used to run the models are available there.
To download the package bdrc, type the following in your R console:           

```{r,eval=FALSE}
    #if not yet installed
    install.packages('devtools')

    devtools::install_github('sor16/bdrc'). 
```
          
To learn about input arguments into the functions, type ? in front of the function name.
